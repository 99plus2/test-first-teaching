# Mega Calculator

Continuing from the previous Calculator lab...

`add` takes two parameters and adds them

`subtract` takes two parameters and subtracts the second from the first

`sum` takes an *array* of parameters and adds them all together

# Bonus

There are also some bonus exercises for when you finish the regular ones. The bonus round will help teach you test-driven *development*, not simply test-guided *learning*.

One of the extra exercises is about [factorials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) (check Wikipedia if you forgot your high school math).
