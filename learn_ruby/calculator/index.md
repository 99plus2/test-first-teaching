# Topics

* functions
* math
* arrays
* iterating/looping

# Calculator

you will build a simple calculator script with the following methods:

`add` takes two parameters and adds them

`subtract` takes two parameters and subtracts the second from the first

# Bonus

There are also some bonus exercises for when you finish the regular ones. The bonus round will help teach you test-driven *development*, not simply test-guided *learning*.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write *tests* for two new methods:

* `multiply` which multiplies two numbers together
* `power` which raises one number to the power of another number
