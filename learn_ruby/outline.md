# Outline of Tests 
* **hello** 
  gives you a feel of how to use these tests and you will write your first class.  See [hello/index.md](hello/index.md) for detailed instructions.
* **temperature**
  Write another class and do some basic math.
* **calculator** introduces a little more math, and you'll need to iterate.
* **Pig Latin** lets you manipulate strings.
* **in\_words**
  Ask a number to say itself in English. Extend a built-in class. By the end you'll use conditionals, arrays, iteration, and maybe even some recursion.
* **blocks** introduces block syntax.
