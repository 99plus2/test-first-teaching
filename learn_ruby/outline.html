<h1>Outline of Tests</h1>

<ul>

<li><strong>temperature</strong>
Write another class and do some basic math.</li>
<li><strong>calculator</strong> introduces a little more math, and you'll need to iterate.</li>
<li><strong>Pig Latin</strong> lets you manipulate strings.</li>
<li><strong>in_words</strong>
Ask a number to say itself in English. Extend a built-in class. By the end you'll use conditionals, arrays, iteration, and maybe even some recursion.</li>

</ul>
