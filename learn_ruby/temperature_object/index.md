# Hints

Remember that one degree fahrenheit is 5/9 of one degree celsius, and that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees celsius but 32 degrees fahrenheit.

Remember to define the `from_celsius` factory method as a *class* method, not an *instance* method.

The temperature object's constructor should accept an *options hash* which contains either a `:celcius` entry or a `:fahrenheit` entry.
