first assignment, in_words_spec.rb, and concept by Alex Chafee

      Notes

Homework time!

sudo gem install rspec
spec in_words_spec.rb

Make it pass! Don't be too ambitious... just work on one spec at a time.

BTW "spec" is another name for "test", and "RSpec" is a spec framework
for Ruby. Should be pretty self-explanatory.
